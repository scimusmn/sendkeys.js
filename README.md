# SendKeys.js

## Purpose
SendKeys is a set of JS files that makes it possible to simulate keypresses from on screen interaction.

## Credits
This is a clone of Daniel Wachsstock's work.

See his [original post on the plugin for more details](http://bililite.com/blog/2011/01/23/improved-sendkeys).

We are cloning it here (with permission) because he hasn't posted a version to GitHub, and we need to use this work in our kiosk projects. We want to make sure it's available in case his website goes away at any point in the future.
